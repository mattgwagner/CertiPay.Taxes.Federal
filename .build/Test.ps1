# script/test is used to run the test suite of the application.

# A good pattern to support is having an optional argument that is a file path. This allows you to support running single tests.

# Linting (i.e. rubocop, jshint, pmd, etc.) can also be considered a form of testing. These tend to run faster than tests, so put them towards the beginning of a script/test so it fails faster if there's a linting problem.

# script/test should be called from script/cibuild, so it should handle setting up the application appropriately based on the environment. For example, if called in a development environment, it should probably call script/update to always ensure that the application is up to date. If called from script/cibuild, it should probably reset the application to a clean state.
